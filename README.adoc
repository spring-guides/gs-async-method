This guide walks you through the steps to create asynchronous queries to GitHub. The focus is on the asynchronous part, a feature often used when scaling services.

== What you'll build

You'll build a lookup service that queries GitHub user information and retrieves data through GitHub's API. One approach to scaling services is to run expensive jobs in the background and wait for the results using Java's {CompletableFuture}[`CompletableFuture`] interface. Java's `CompletableFuture` is an evolution from the regular `Future`. It makes it easy to pipeline multiple asynchronous operations merging them into a single asynchronous computation.

== What you'll need

== Create a representation of a GitHub User

Before you can create a GitHub lookup service, you need to define a representation for the data you'll retrieve through GitHub's API.

To model the user representation, you create a resource representation class. Provide a plain old Java object with fields, constructors, and accessors:

`src/main/java/hello/User.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/User.java[]
----

Spring uses the {jackson}[Jackson JSON] library to convert GitHub's JSON response into a `User` object. The `@JsonIgnoreProperties` annotation signals Spring to ignore any attributes not listed in the class. This makes it easy to make REST calls and produce domain objects.

In this guide, we are only grabbing the `name` and the `blog` URL for demonstration purposes.


== Create a GitHub lookup service

Next you need to create a service that queries GitHub to find user information.

`src/main/java/hello/GitHubLookupService.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/GitHubLookupService.java[]
----

The `GitHubLookupService` class uses Spring's `RestTemplate` to invoke a remote REST point
(api.github.com/users/), and then convert the answer into a `User` object. Spring Boot automatically provides a `RestTemplateBuilder` that customizes the defaults with any auto-configuration bits (i.e. `MessageConverter`).

The class is marked with the `@Service` annotation, making it a candidate for Spring's component scanning to detect it and add it to the link:/understanding/application-context[application context].

The `findUser` method is flagged with Spring's `@Async` annotation, indicating it will run on a separate thread. The method's return type is {CompletableFuture}[`CompletableFuture<User>`] instead of `User`, a requirement for any asynchronous service. This code uses the `completedFuture` method to return a `CompletableFuture` instance which is already completed with result of the GitHub query.

NOTE: Creating a local instance of the `GitHubLookupService` class does NOT allow the `findUser` method to run asynchronously. It must be created inside a `@Configuration` class or picked up by `@ComponentScan`.

The timing for GitHub's API can vary. To demonstrate the benefits later in this guide, an extra delay of one second has been added to this service.

== Make the application executable

To run a sample, you can create an executable jar. Spring's `@Async` annotation works with web apps, but you don't need all the extra steps of setting up a web container to see its benefits.


`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/spring-boot-application.adoc[]

The {EnableAsync}[`@EnableAsync`] annotation switches on Spring's ability to run `@Async` methods in a background thread pool. This class also customizes the used `Executor`. In our case, we want to limit the number of concurrent threads to 2 and limit the size of the queue to 500. There are {Executor}[many more things you can tune]. By default, a `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor` is used.

There is also a {runner}[`CommandLineRunner`] that injects the `GitHubLookupService` and calls that service 3 times to demonstrate the method is executed asynchronously.

`src/main/java/hello/AppRunner.java`
[source,java]

include::complete/src/main/java/hello/AppRunner.java[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


Logging output is displayed, showing each query to GitHub. With the help of `allOf` factory method we create an array of `CompletableFutures` on which by calling the `join`
method makes it possible to wait for the completion of all of the `CompletableFutures`.

....

....

Note that the first two calls happen in separate threads (`GithubLookup-2`, `GithubLookup-1`) and the third one is parked until one of the two threads became available. To compare how long this takes without the asynchronous feature, try commenting out the `@Async` annotation and run the service again. The total elapsed time should increase noticeably because each query takes at least a second. You can also tune the `Executor` to increase the `corePoolSize` attribute for instance.

Essentially, the longer the task takes and the more tasks are invoked simultaneously, the more benefit you will see with making things asynchronous. The trade off is handling the `CompletableFuture` interface. It adds a layer of indirection because you are no longer dealing directly with the results.

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed an asynchronous service that lets you scale multiple calls at once.
